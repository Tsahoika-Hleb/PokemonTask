# PokemonTask

This application allows you to get pokemon information from pokeapi.
You can find out the name, height, weight, types, as well as see 3 different images or art of each Pokemon.

The application allows you to save data about Pokemon with the help of CoreData and, if it is missing, loads it using the API
